      (also referred to as Company), to the terms and conditions as set forth
      herein. In the event you do not agree or do not have the authority to

      implemented at SAP containing the assessment results submitted by various
      SAP customers. As noted above, the data concerning Participant's company
      is collected by means of the assessment in which you are currently
      enrolled. 'Confidential Information of SAP' or 'Confidential Information
      of Company' shall mean all information defined herein. SAP shall treat the
      responses as the Confidential Information of Company. The results will be
      published only in an anonymous way so that no conclusions about the source
      of the data will be possible. By providing responses to the assessment, or
      by clicking the accept button, Participant irrevocably consents that any
      data provided to SAP therein may be transferred, used and stored by SAP
      worldwide and royalty-free for the purposes and in the way described
      herein above. All results derived from the Feedback or any response(s)
      which are not identified as belonging to Company shall be treated as the
      Confidential Information of SAP and SAP shall be entitled to use the
      foregoing without remuneration of any kind to Participant or Company.
      Additionally, the online assessment content and questions, furthermore any
      other material that is identified as SAP Confidential are the Confidential
      Information of SAP. The parties shall protect the other party's respective
      Confidential Information from disclosure in accordance with these terms
      and the terms of any existing End User License Agreement between SAP (or
      its affiliated companies) and Company. In particular SAP and Company shall
      (i) take all reasonable steps (defined below) to maintain Confidential
      Information in strict confidence, taking steps to protect Confidential
      Information at least as protective as those steps that they take to
      protect their own proprietary and confidential information of a similar
      nature, but in no event less than a reasonable standard of care; (ii) not
      to disclose or reveal any Confidential Information to any person other
      than its representatives on a need-to-know basis and only to the extent
      necessary to accomplish the intent of this assessment and who are under
      obligations of confidentiality substantially similar to those set forth
      herein (iii) not use or reproduce the Confidential Information in any form
      except as required to accomplish the intent of this assessment. Any
      reproduction of any SAP Confidential Information shall remain the property
      of SAP and shall contain any and all confidential, internal, or
      proprietary notices or legends which appear on the original and on any
      reproductions; and (iv) not reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile, or
      attempt to derive any underlying source code, ideas or methods from the
      Confidential Information without the prior written permission of SAP.
      Company shall (i) be responsible for any breach of these terms by it or
      its representatives, (ii) make its representatives aware of the
      restriction imposed on the Confidential Information, (iii) and require its
      representatives to observe the obligation of confidentiality. The above
      restrictions on the use and disclosure of Confidential Information shall
      not apply to any Confidential Information that: (a) has become generally
      known or available to the public through no act or omission on the part of
      the SAP or the Company; (b) at the time of disclosure to the other party
      was known to that party free of restriction; (c) is lawfully acquired free
      of restriction by the receiving party from a third party having the right
      to furnish such Confidential Information; or (d) is independently
      developed by one of the parties without reference or access to the
      Confidential Information, or is lawfully received free of restriction from
      a third party having the right to furnish such Confidential Information.
      If a EULA between SAP and the Company exists, the confidentiality terms
      thereof prevail over the confidentiality terms of these Terms and
      Conditions.
