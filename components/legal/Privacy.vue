      </li>

      <li class="py-2">
        Creating user profiles - Certain web offerings linked to SAP's websites,
        including forums, blogs, and networks (e.g., the SAP Community), require
        you to register and create a user profile. Through the user profile you
        can share personal information about you with other users, such as your
        name, photo, social media accounts, postal or email address, telephone
        number, personal interests, skills, and basic information about your
        company. The user profiles serve to personalize the interactions between
        the users (for example, by way of messaging or follow functionality) and
        to allow SAP to foster the collaboration and quality of communication
        through such offerings. The profile settings of the relevant web
        offering allow you to determine which information you want to share.
      </li>

      <li class="py-2">
        Identity service - The user profile may be specific to a single web
        offering of SAP, but it also allows you to access other web offerings of
        SAP or of other entities of the SAP Group. It is your choice whether or
        not to use any of these additional web offerings. If you do, SAP will
        make your Personal Data available to such other web offering to provide
        you with initial access. Kindly note that without your consent for SAP
        to create such user profiles, SAP will not be able to offer such
        services to you where your consent is a statutory requirement that SAP
        can provide these services to you.

        relevant material, product, or service. SAP may also invite you to
        participate in questionnaires and surveys. These will generally be
        designed so you can participate without having to provide information
        that identifies you as a participant. If you nonetheless provide your

        SAP and its products, technologies, and services are subject to the
        export laws of various countries including, without limitation, those of
        the European Union and its member states, and of the United States of
        America. Applicable export laws, trade sanctions, and embargoes issued
        by these countries oblige SAP to prevent organizations, legal entities
        and other parties listed on government-issued sanctioned-party lists
        from accessing certain products, technologies, and services through
        SAP's websites or other delivery channels (e.g. the European Union

        Assets Control's (OFAC) Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked
        Persons List (SDN-List) and the US DOCs Bureau of Industry and
        Security's Entity Lists and the United Nations Security Council
        Sanctions). SAP processes personal data to the extent necessary to
        comply with these legal requirements. Specifically, SAP processes
        personal data to conduct automated checks against applicable
        sanctioned-party lists, to regularly repeat such checks whenever a
        sanctioned-party list is updated or when a user updates his or her
        information. In case of a potential match, SAP will block access to
        SAP's services and systems and contact the user to confirm his or her
        identity.

        <h4>How does SAP justify international data transfers?</h4>

        As a global group of companies, SAP has group affiliates and uses third
        party service providers also in countries outside the European Economic
        Area (the "EEA”). SAP may transfer your Personal Data to countries
        outside the EEA as part of SAP's international business operations. If
        We transfer Personal Data from a country in the EU or the EEA to a
        country outside the EEA and for which the EU Commission has not issued
        an adequacy decision, SAP uses the EU standard contractual clauses to
        contractually require the data importer to ensure a level of data
        protection consistent with the one in the EEA to protect your Personal
        Data. You may obtain a copy (redacted to remove commercial or irrelevant
        information) of such standard contractual clauses by sending a request
        to
        <NuxtLink class="underline" to="mailto:privacy@sap.com"
          >privacy@sap.com</NuxtLink

      <u>Data Subject Access Requests:</u>

      SAP receives Data Subject Access Requests from across the globe and works
      to ensure all valid requests where SAP is the Controller are responded to
      within the appropriate timeframe. In accordance with the verification
      process set forth in the CCPA, SAP will require a more stringent
      verification process for deletion requests, or for Personal Data that is
      considered sensitive or valuable, to minimize the harm that might be posed
      to you by unauthorized access or deletion of your Personal Data. If SAP
      must request additional information from you outside of information that
      is already maintained by SAP, SAP will only use it to verify your identity
      so you can exercise your data protection rights, or for security and
      fraud-prevention purposes. In addition to contacting SAP at

      rights to SAP. Such authorized agent must be registered with the
      California Secretary of State and submit proof that you have given
